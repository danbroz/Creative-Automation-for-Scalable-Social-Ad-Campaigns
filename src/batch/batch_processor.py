"""
Batch Campaign Processor
========================

Processes multiple campaign briefs concurrently using a worker pool pattern.
Provides parallel execution, progress tracking, and comprehensive error handling
for processing large numbers of campaigns efficiently.

Architecture:
    - Main process orchestrates the batch
    - Worker threads/processes handle individual campaigns
    - Queue-based work distribution
    - Result aggregation and reporting

Performance:
    - Can process 50+ campaigns concurrently (configurable)
    - Automatic load balancing across workers
    - Failed campaigns can be retried automatically
